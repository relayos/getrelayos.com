## Product Documentation Guidelines

### PRD (Product Requirements Document)

The PRD serves as the definitive source of truth for what a product is, why it exists, and how it should function. It is a comprehensive document that outlines:

1. **Product Vision**: The core purpose and value proposition
2. **Market Analysis**: Target audience, competitive landscape, and positioning
3. **Feature Requirements**: Core features, future enhancements, and technical specifications
4. **User Experience**: User flows, UI/UX guidelines, and design principles
5. **Implementation Plan**: Timeline, milestones, and dependencies

Use the `prd_template.md` as a starting point for creating new PRDs.

### GTM (Go-to-Market) Messaging Framework

The GTM Messaging Framework defines how we communicate about the product to the market. It includes:

1. **Core Messaging**: Brand essence, promise, and personality
2. **Positioning Statement**: How the product should be perceived in the market
3. **Target Audience Messaging**: Tailored messages for different audience segments
4. **Competitive Differentiation**: Key differentiators and competitive messaging
5. **Channel-Specific Messaging**: Tailored approaches for different marketing channels

Use the `gtm_framework.md` as a starting point for creating new GTM messaging frameworks.

## Workflow for Creating Product Documentation

1. Create the appropriate directory structure for the product
2. Copy the template files to the product directory
3. Fill in the template with product-specific information
4. Review and iterate on the documentation
5. Update the documentation as the product evolves

## Relationship Between PRD and GTM

The PRD and GTM documents are closely related but serve different purposes:

- **PRD**: Internal document focused on what the product is and how it should work
- **GTM**: External-facing document focused on how to communicate about the product

The GTM should be derived from and aligned with the PRD, but with a focus on messaging and positioning rather than technical requirements.
