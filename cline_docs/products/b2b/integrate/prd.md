### Privacy Configuration Framework
RelayOS Integrate™ includes a comprehensive Privacy Configuration Framework that enables developers and organizations to precisely control how data is used across all API and integration features, ensuring a balance between advanced functionality and privacy protection:

1. **Global Privacy Levels**: Three pre-configured privacy profiles that serve as starting points:
   - **Maximum Privacy**: Prioritizes data privacy above all else, limiting functionality to features that can operate with minimal data access. Ideal for highly regulated industries or sensitive integrations.
   - **Balanced Privacy**: Carefully balances privacy protection with enhanced functionality through selective feature enablement and privacy safeguards. Suitable for most enterprise deployments.
   - **Enhanced Functionality**: Maximizes available features while maintaining reasonable privacy protections. Appropriate for teams prioritizing functionality with standard privacy safeguards.

2. **Feature-Specific Settings**: Granular control over individual features:
   - **API Access Controls**: Configure what data is accessible through different API endpoints
   - **Webhook Privacy**: Control what data is shared in webhook payloads
   - **Integration Data Flows**: Manage data sharing between integrated systems
   - **Analytics Collection**: Configure what API usage data is analyzed for insights
   - **Authentication Scope**: Control the scope of access tokens and permissions

3. **Data Category Controls**: Specific controls for different categories of data:
   - **User Data**: Profile information, contact details, authentication data
   - **Message Data**: Content, metadata, attachments
   - **System Data**: Configuration, settings, integration parameters
   - **Analytics Data**: Usage patterns, performance metrics, error information

4. **Processing Location Options**: Multiple options for where data processing occurs:
   - **On-Premises Processing**: Data processed entirely within the organization's infrastructure
   - **Secure Enclave Processing**: Isolated, secure computing environments
   - **Cloud Processing**: Processing in RelayOS's secure cloud environment
   - **Hybrid Processing**: Combination based on data sensitivity and requirements

5. **Retention Policies**: Configurable retention for different data types:
   - **Transient Processing**: No retention (ephemeral processing only)
   - **Short-Term Retention**: 1-30 days
   - **Medium-Term Retention**: 1-6 months
   - **Long-Term Retention**: 6+ months
   - **Custom Retention**: Organization-defined policies

The framework provides developers and administrators with intuitive interfaces for managing privacy settings, with appropriate controls for different organizational roles and clear visibility into the privacy implications of different configurations.

### Performance Requirements
- **Scalability:** Support for high-volume API usage with up to 10,000 requests per second per customer. Ability to scale horizontally to accommodate traffic spikes and growing usage patterns.
- **Reliability:** 99.99% API availability with redundant infrastructure and automatic failover mechanisms. Comprehensive retry logic, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation for resilient operations.
