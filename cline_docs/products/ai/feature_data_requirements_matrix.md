## Privacy Configuration Options

### Global Privacy Levels
1. **Maximum Privacy**: Only essential data processed, limited functionality
   - AI features disabled or limited to on-device processing
   - Minimal metadata collection
   - No optional data processing
   - Shortest possible data retention

2. **Balanced Privacy**: Selective feature enablement with privacy safeguards
   - AI features enabled with explicit consent per feature
   - Anonymized data collection where possible
   - Limited optional data processing
   - Moderate data retention with regular purging

3. **Enhanced Functionality**: Most features enabled with privacy considerations
   - AI features fully enabled with general consent
   - Standard data collection with privacy safeguards
   - Optional data processing for improved functionality
   - Standard data retention with user controls

### Feature-Specific Controls
Users and B2B customers can configure privacy settings for each feature independently:

- **Opt-in/Opt-out**: Each AI-enhanced feature can be enabled or disabled
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention periods for different data types
- **Processing Location**: Options for local vs. server processing where applicable
- **Data Minimization**: Controls for what data is used for each feature
- **Anonymization Level**: Options for degree of anonymization in data processing

## Implementation Guidelines

### User Consent Framework
- **Explicit Consent**: Clear opt-in for AI features that require server-side processing
- **Granular Control**: Feature-by-feature consent rather than all-or-nothing
- **Informed Decisions**: Clear explanations of data usage for each feature
- **Revocable Consent**: Easy opt-out at any time with data deletion options

### B2B Customer Controls
- **Organization Policies**: Ability to set organization-wide privacy defaults
- **Role-Based Settings**: Different privacy settings for different user roles
- **Compliance Configuration**: Pre-set configurations for different regulatory requirements
- **Audit Capabilities**: Logging and verification of privacy settings enforcement

### Technical Implementation
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations built into feature architecture
- **Data Minimization**: Only collecting and processing necessary data
- **Secure Processing**: Encryption in transit and at rest for all data
- **Ephemeral Processing**: Processing without persistent storage where possible
- **Federated Learning**: Where applicable, using techniques that keep data local

## Balancing Privacy and Functionality

### Decision Framework
When deciding whether to enable features that require data processing:

1. **Necessity**: Is this feature essential for the intended use case?
2. **Alternatives**: Are there more privacy-preserving alternatives available?
3. **Safeguards**: What privacy protections can be implemented?
4. **Transparency**: Is data usage clearly communicated to users?
5. **Control**: Do users have meaningful control over their data?

### Use Case Examples

#### High Privacy Use Case: Sensitive Communications
- AI-Enhanced Moderation: Disabled or limited to client-side
- Chat Summarization: Disabled
- Interactive UI Elements: Enabled (client-side processing)
- Voice & Video: Enabled with E2E encryption, no recording
- Analytics: Minimal metadata only

#### Balanced Use Case: Team Collaboration
- AI-Enhanced Moderation: Enabled with anonymization
- Chat Summarization: Enabled with opt-in per conversation
- Interactive UI Elements: Fully enabled
- Voice & Video: Enabled with optional recording (explicit consent)
- Analytics: Enabled with aggregated data

#### Functionality-Focused Use Case: Customer Support
- AI-Enhanced Moderation: Fully enabled
- Chat Summarization: Automatically enabled
- Interactive UI Elements: Fully enabled
- Voice & Video: Enabled with recording for quality assurance
- Analytics: Comprehensive with appropriate disclosures
