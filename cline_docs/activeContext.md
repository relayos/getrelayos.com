# Active Context

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the RelayOS website project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:**  List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:**  List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

## Current Work Focus:

- Strategy phase in progress
- Completed PRD and GTM messaging for RelayOS Embed™, Connect™, and Integrate™
- Developing comprehensive product documentation for all RelayOS products

## Next Steps:

1. Create PRD for RelayOS Persist™ (first B2C product)
2. Develop GTM messaging for RelayOS Persist™
3. Continue with remaining products in priority order (Communities™, AI features)
4. Review dependency trackers and verify relationships

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- How to structure PRDs to capture both technical requirements and marketing positioning
- Whether to create separate PRD documents for each product or use a unified template
- How to align GTM messaging across different product lines while maintaining distinct value propositions
- What level of detail to include in PRDs for existing vs. planned product features
