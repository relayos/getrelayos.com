# Active Context

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the RelayOS website project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:**  List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:**  List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

## Current Work Focus:

- Strategy phase in progress
- Completed PRD and GTM messaging for all RelayOS products: Embed™, Connect™, Integrate™, Persist™, Communities™, and Nexus™
- Finalizing comprehensive product documentation suite

## Next Steps:

1. Review dependency trackers and verify relationships
2. Implement privacy approach review strategy as outlined in `cline_docs/products/privacy_approach_review.md`
3. Review all product docs to replace placeholders with real details or eliminate them
4. Prepare for transition to Execution phase for website implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- How to balance the privacy-first approach with the need for data access, particularly for AI features
- How to segment Communities™ into two sub-products (high-ticket isolated private IRC network vs. regular multi-tenant IRC network)
- How to showcase integration capabilities (like n8n, x402 payments) without overcommitting to specific implementations
- What level of detail to include in PRDs for existing vs. planned product features
