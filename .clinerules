# CRCT System Parent Configuration
# This file points to the actual .clinerules file in the .crct submodule

[SUBMODULE_REFERENCE]
clinerules_path: `.crct/.clinerules`
notes: "This is a reference file. All CRCT system configuration is stored in the `.crct` submodule."

[PATHS]
memory_dir: "cline_docs"
notes: "This overrides the memory_dir in .crct/.clinerules.config.json to ensure project-specific files are stored in the parent project's cline_docs directory, not copied from .crct/cline_docs"

[SUBMODULE_EXCLUSIONS]
# Directories that should not be copied from the submodule to the parent project
excluded_directories:
  - "prompts"
  - "templates"
notes: "These directories contain system files that should remain in the submodule and not be copied to the parent project"

[INSTRUCTIONS]
- Do not modify the [SUBMODULE_REFERENCE] section.
- CRCT system files are stored in the `.crct` directory. Do not modify the contents, it is read-only by design.
- To configure the CRCT system, you may extend this `.clinerules` file.
- All CRCT system output, such as project-specific documentation is stored under a `cline_docs` directory, distinct from `.crct/cline_docs`.
- Project-specific configuration can be added to the [PROJECT_CONFIGURATION] section below.
- When using the CRCT system as a submodule, always check the GitOps configuration and perform GitOps operations at the beginning and end of task execution to ensure changes are properly tracked, committed, and pushed to the remote repository.

[LEARNING_JOURNAL]
- Regularly updating cline_docs and any instruction files help me to remember what I have done and what still needs to be done so I don't lose track.
- When initializing the BRCT system as a submodule, create project-specific files in the parent project's cline_docs directory, not in the .crct/cline_docs directory.
- The .crct directory is read-only and contains the BRCT system files, while project-specific files are stored in the cline_docs directory.
- For the Strategy phase, focusing on PRD and GTM messaging for each product helps establish clear requirements and market positioning before implementation.
- When creating product documentation for related products, maintaining consistent terminology and messaging while differentiating value propositions is essential for a cohesive product family.
- The B2B product suite (Embed™, Connect™, Integrate™) forms a comprehensive communication ecosystem with each product serving a distinct purpose while sharing common enterprise-grade security and reliability foundations.
- The B2C product suite (Persist™, Communities™) focuses on individual user empowerment and privacy, with Persist™ emphasizing data ownership and control while maintaining an intuitive user experience for privacy management.
- RelayOS Communities™ complements Persist™ by focusing on social connections and community building while maintaining the same privacy-first approach, creating a comprehensive B2C offering that addresses both personal data management and social interaction needs.
- RelayOS Nexus™ serves as an intelligent integration hub that connects the entire RelayOS ecosystem with AI capabilities and third-party platform connectivity, emphasizing enterprise control for B2B customers and enhanced communication experiences for B2C users.
- The privacy-first approach may need to be balanced with practical considerations for certain features, particularly AI capabilities that require data access for functionality like content moderation and conversation summarization.
- A balanced privacy approach with configurable controls allows users and organizations to make informed choices about privacy trade-offs based on their specific needs and use cases.
- Providing detailed documentation about data requirements for each feature creates transparency and builds trust with users concerned about privacy.
- Tiered product offerings can effectively address different privacy and security needs across various customer segments while maintaining a consistent product philosophy.
- Enterprise governance and B2B customer control are essential components of a privacy framework that must coexist with end-user privacy protections.
