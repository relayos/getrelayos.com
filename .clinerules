# CRCT System Parent Configuration
# This file points to the actual .clinerules file in the .crct submodule

[SUBMODULE_REFERENCE]
clinerules_path: `.crct/.clinerules`
notes: "This is a reference file. All CRCT system configuration is stored in the `.crct` submodule."

[PATHS]
memory_dir: "cline_docs"
notes: "This overrides the memory_dir in .crct/.clinerules.config.json to ensure project-specific files are stored in the parent project's cline_docs directory, not copied from .crct/cline_docs"

[SUBMODULE_EXCLUSIONS]
# Directories that should not be copied from the submodule to the parent project
excluded_directories:
  - "prompts"
  - "templates"
notes: "These directories contain system files that should remain in the submodule and not be copied to the parent project"

[INSTRUCTIONS]
- Do not modify the [SUBMODULE_REFERENCE] section.
- CRCT system files are stored in the `.crct` directory. Do not modify the contents, it is read-only by design.
- To configure the CRCT system, you may extend this `.clinerules` file.
- All CRCT system output, such as project-specific documentation is stored under a `cline_docs` directory, distinct from `.crct/cline_docs`.
- Project-specific configuration can be added to the [PROJECT_CONFIGURATION] section below.
- When using the CRCT system as a submodule, always check the GitOps configuration and perform GitOps operations at the beginning and end of task execution to ensure changes are properly tracked, committed, and pushed to the remote repository.
